# Not Enough PvP
Hello, this is my first ever mod for Minecraft so don't expect anything big. This mod is for **Fabric**.

For now, the only feature is to show what armor piece you're missing.

You can toggle the missing armor feature by pressing "G", you can change this to any key you want in the keybindings menu. You can change the position of the HUD in the config by changing the value of "position" to "left", "middle" or "right" or by toggling "overwrite position" to true and changing the "x position" to any value you want.
