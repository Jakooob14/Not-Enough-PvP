# Not Enough PvP
Hello this is my first ever mod for Minecraft so don't expects anything big. 

For now the only feature is to show what armor piece you're missing.

You can toggle the armor missing feature by pressing "G" you can change this to any key you want in controls. You can change the position of it in the config by changing the value of "position" to "left", "middle" or "right" or by toggling "overwrite position" to true and changing the "x position" to any value you want.
